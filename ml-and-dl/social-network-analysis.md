[**Nicholas Christakis**](http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/soc/faculty/christakis/) **of Harvard and** [**James Fowler**](http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/) **of UC San Diego have produced a series of ground-breaking papers analyzing the spread of various traits in social networks:** [**obesity**](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/357/4/370)**,** [**smoking**](http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/358/21/2249)**,** [**happiness**](http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/337/dec04_2/a2338)**, and most recently, in collaboration with John Cacioppo,** [**loneliness**](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1319108)**. The Christakis-Fowler collaboration has now become** [**well-known**](http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/science_friendship_as_a_health_factor.pdf)**, but from a technical perspective, what was special about their work?**

**It turns out that they found a way to distinguish between the three reasons why people who are related in a social network are similar to each other.**

1. **Homophily is the tendency of people to seek others who are alike. For example, most of us restrict our dates to smokers or non-smokers, mirroring our own behavior.**
2. **Confounding is the phenomenon of related individuals developing a trait because of a \(shared\) environmental circumstance. For example, people living right next to a McDonaldâ€™s might all gradually become obese.**
3. **Induction is the process of one individual passing a trait or behavior on to their friends, whether by active encouragement or by setting an example**
4. [**Networkx**](https://networkx.org/documentation//networkx-1.10/reference/algorithms.html) **- Centrality is just a fraction of the algorithms contained in networkx.**
