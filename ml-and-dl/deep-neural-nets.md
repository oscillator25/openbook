# Deep Neural Nets

* **Jay Alammar on NN** [**Part 1**](http://jalammar.github.io/visual-interactive-guide-basics-neural-networks/)**,** [**Part 2**](http://jalammar.github.io/feedforward-neural-networks-visual-interactive/)
* [**NN in general**](http://briandolhansky.com/blog/?tag=neural+network#show-archive) **- 5 introductions  tutorials.**
* [**Segmentation examples**](https://meetshah1995.github.io/semantic-segmentation/deep-learning/pytorch/visdom/2017/06/01/semantic-segmentation-over-the-years.html)

**MLP: fully connected, input, hidden layers, output. Gradient on the backprop takes a lot of time to calculate. Has vanishing gradient problem, because of multiplications when it reaches the first layers the loss correction is very small \(0.1\*0.1\*01 = 0.001\), therefore the early layers train slower than the last ones, and the early ones capture the basics structures so they are the more important ones.**

**AutoEncoder - unsupervised, drives the input through fully connected layers, sometime reducing their neurons amount, then does the reverse and expands the layer’s size to get to the input \(images are multiplied by the transpose matrix, many times over\), Comparing the predicted output to the input, correcting the cost using gradient descent and redoing it, until the networks learns the output.**

* **Convolutional auto encoder**
* **Denoiser auto encoder - masking areas in order to create an encoder that understands noisy images**
* **Variational autoencoder - doesnt rely on distance between pixels, rather it maps them to a function \(gaussian\), eventually the DS should be explained by this mapping, uses 2 new layers added to the network. Gaussian will create blurry images, but similar. Please note that it also works with CNN.**

**What are** [**logits**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41455101/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-logits-in-tensorflow) **in neural net - the vector of raw \(non-normalized\) predictions that a classification model generates, which is ordinarily then passed to a normalization function. If the model is solving a multi-class classification problem, logits typically become an input to the softmax function. The softmax function then generates a vector of \(normalized\) probabilities with one value for each possible class.**

[**WORD2VEC**](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/) **- based on autoencode, we keep only the hidden layer ,** [**Part 2**](http://mccormickml.com/2017/01/11/word2vec-tutorial-part-2-negative-sampling/)

**RBM- restricted \(no 2 nodes share a connection\) boltzman machine**

**An Autoencoder of features, tries to encode its own structure.**

**Works best on pics, video, voice, sensor data. 2 layers, visible and hidden, error and bias calculated via KL Divergence.**

* **Also known as a shallow network.**
* **Two layers, input and output, goes back and forth until it learns its output.**

**DBN - deep belief networks, similar structure to multi layer perceptron. fully connected, input, hidden\(s\), output layers. Can be thought of as stacks of RBM. training using GPU optimization, accurate and needs smaller labelled data set to complete the training.**

**Solves the ‘vanishing gradient’ problem, imagine a fully connected network, advancing each 2 layers step by step until each boltzman network \(2 layers\) learns the output, keeps advancing until finished.. Each layer learns the entire input.**

**Next step is to fine tune using a labelled test set, improves performance and alters the net. So basically using labeled samples we fine tune and associate features and pattern with a name. Weights and biases are altered slightly and there is also an increase in performance. Unlike CNN which learns features then high level features.**

**Accurate and reasonable in time, unlike fully connected that has the vanishing gradient problem.**

**Transfer Learning = like Inception in Tensor flow, use a prebuilt network to solve many problems that “work” similarly to the original network.**

* [**CS course definition**](http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/) **- also very good explanation of the common use cases:**
  * **Feature extraction from the CNN part \(removing the fully connected layer\)**
  * **Fine-tuning, everything or partial selection of the hidden layers, mainly good to keep low level neurons that know what edges and color blobs are, but not dog breeds or something not as general.**

* **basic NN node with a loop, previous output is merged with current input. for the purpose of remembering history, for time series, to predict the next X based on the previous Y.** 
* **1 to N = frame captioning**
* **N to 1 = classification**

## **GRADIENT DESCENT**

**\(**[**What are**](http://machinelearningmastery.com/gentle-introduction-mini-batch-gradient-descent-configure-batch-size/)**?\) batch, stochastic, and mini-batch gradient descent are and the benefits and limitations of each method.**

[**What is gradient descent, how to use it, local minima okay to use, compared to global. Saddle points, learning rate strategies and research points**](https://blog.paperspace.com/intro-to-optimization-in-deep-learning-gradient-descent/)

1. **Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often used for finding the weights or coefficients of machine learning algorithms, such as artificial neural networks and logistic regression.**
2. **the model makes predictions on training data, then use the error on the predictions to update the model to reduce the error.**
3. **The goal of the algorithm is to find model parameters \(e.g. coefficients or weights\) that minimize the error of the model on the training dataset. It does this by making changes to the model that move it along a gradient or slope of errors down toward a minimum error value. This gives the algorithm its name of “gradient descent.”**

### **Stochastic**

* **calculate error and updates the model after every training sample**

### **Batch**

* **calculates the error for each example in the training dataset, but only updates the model after all training examples have been evaluated.**

### **Mini batch \(most common\)**

* **splits the training dataset into small batches, used to calculate model error and update model coefficients.** 
* **Implementations may choose to sum the gradient over the mini-batch or take the average of the gradient \(reduces variance of gradient\) \(unclear?\)**

**+ Tips on how to choose and train using mini batch in the link above**

* [**Big batches are not the cause for the ‘generalization gap’ between mini and big batches, it is not advisable to use large batches because of the low update rate, however if you change that, authors claim its okay**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08741)**.**
* [**So what is a batch size in NN \(another source\)**](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/153531/what-is-batch-size-in-neural-network) **- and how to find the “right” number. In general terms a good mini bach between 1 and all samples is a good idea. Figure it out empirically.** 
* **one epoch = one forward pass and one backward pass of all the training examples**
* **batch size = the number of training examples in one forward/backward pass. The higher the batch size, the more memory space you'll need.**
* **number of iterations = number of passes, each pass using \[batch size\] number of examples. To be clear, one pass = one forward pass + one backward pass \(we do not count the forward pass and backward pass as two different passes\).**

**Example: if you have 1000 training examples, and your batch size is 500, then it will take 2 iterations to complete 1 epoch.**

## **Batch size**

**\(**[**a good read\)**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-different-batch-sizes-training-predicting-python-keras/) **about batch sizes in keras, specifically LSTM, read this first!**

**A sequence prediction problem makes a good case for a varied batch size as you may want to have a batch size equal to the training dataset size \(batch learning\) during training and a batch size of 1 when making predictions for one-step outputs.**

**power of 2: have some advantages with regards to vectorized operations in certain packages, so if it's close it might be faster to keep your batch\_size in a power of 2.**

**\(**[**pushing batches of samples to memory in order to train\)**](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/153531/what-is-batch-size-in-neural-network) **-**

**Batch size defines number of samples that going to be propagated through the network.**

**For instance, let's say you have 1050 training samples and you want to set up batch\_size equal to 100. Algorithm takes first 100 samples \(from 1st to 100th\) from the training dataset and trains network. Next it takes second 100 samples \(from 101st to 200th\) and train network again. We can keep doing this procedure until we will propagate through the networks all samples. The problem usually happens with the last set of samples. In our example we've used 1050 which is not divisible by 100 without remainder. The simplest solution is just to get final 50 samples and train the network.**

**Advantages:**

* **It requires less memory. Since you train network using less number of samples the overall training procedure requires less memory. It's especially important in case if you are not able to fit dataset in memory.**
* **Typically networks trains faster with mini-batches. That's because we update weights after each propagation. In our example we've propagated 11 batches \(10 of them had 100 samples and 1 had 50 samples\) and after each of them we've updated network's parameters. If we used all samples during propagation we would make only 1 update for the network's parameter.**

**Disadvantages:**

* **The smaller the batch the less accurate estimate of the gradient. In the figure below you can see that mini-batch \(green color\) gradient's direction fluctuates compare to the full batch \(blue color\).**

[**Another observation, probably empirical**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35050753/how-big-should-batch-size-and-number-of-epochs-be-when-fitting-a-model-in-keras) **- to answer your questions on Batch Size and Epochs:**

**In general: Larger batch sizes result in faster progress in training, but don't always converge as fast. Smaller batch sizes train slower, but can converge faster. It's definitely problem dependent.**

**In general, the models improve with more epochs of training, to a point. They'll start to plateau in accuracy as they converge. Try something like 50 and plot number of epochs \(x axis\) vs. accuracy \(y axis\). You'll see where it levels out.**

[**What is the diff between batch/layer/recurrent batch and back rnn normalization**](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/12956/paper-whats-the-difference-between-layer-normalization-recurrent-batch-normal)

* **Layer normalization \(Ba 2016\): Does not use batch statistics. Normalize using the statistics collected from all units within a layer of the current sample. Does not work well with ConvNets.**
* **Recurrent Batch Normalization \(BN\) \(Cooijmans, 2016; also proposed concurrently by Qianli Liao & Tomaso Poggio, but tested on Recurrent ConvNets, instead of RNN/LSTM\): Same as batch normalization. Use different normalization statistics for each time step. You need to store a set of mean and standard deviation for each time step.**
* **Batch Normalized Recurrent Neural Networks \(Laurent, 2015\): batch normalization is only applied between the input and hidden state, but not between hidden states. i.e., normalization is not applied over time.**
* **Streaming Normalization \(Liao et al. 2016\) : it summarizes existing normalizations and overcomes most issues mentioned above. It works well with ConvNets, recurrent learning and online learning \(i.e., small mini-batch or one sample at a time\):**
* **Weight Normalization \(Salimans and Kingma 2016\): whenever a weight is used, it is divided by its L2 norm first, such that the resulting weight has L2 norm 1. That is, output y=x∗\(w/\|w\|\), where x and w denote the input and weight respectively. A scalar scaling factor g is then multiplied to the output y=y∗g. But in my experience g seems not essential for performance \(also downstream learnable layers can learn this anyway\).**
* **Cosine Normalization \(Luo et al. 2017\): weight normalization is very similar to cosine normalization, where the same L2 normalization is applied to both weight and input: y=\(x/\|x\|\)∗\(w/\|w\|\). Again, manual or automatic differentiation can compute appropriate gradients of x and w.**
* **Note that both Weight and Cosine Normalization have been extensively used \(called normalized dot product\) in the 2000s in a class of ConvNets called HMAX \(Riesenhuber 1999\) to model biological vision. You may find them interesting.**

1. [**A disciplined approach to neural network hyper-parameters: Part 1 -- learning rate, batch size, momentum, and weight decay**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820)

## **LOSS**

[**Very Basic advice**](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/232754/reference-to-learn-how-to-interpret-learning-curves-of-deep-convolutional-neural)**: You should probably switch train/validation repartition to something like 80% training and 20% validation. In most cases it will improve the classifier performance overall \(more training data = better performance\)**

**+If Training error and test error are too close \(your system is unable to overfit on your training data\), this means that your model is too simple. Solution: more layers or more neurons per layer.**

**Early stopping**

**If you have never heard about "early-stopping" you should look it up, it's an important concept in the neural network domain :** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early\_stopping**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_stopping) **. To summarize, the idea behind early-stopping is to stop the training once the validation loss starts plateauing. Indeed, when this happens it almost always mean you are starting to overfitt your classifier. The training loss value in itself is not something you should trust, beacause it will continue to increase event when you are overfitting your classifier.**

**With** [**cross entropy**](https://www.quora.com/Loss-cross-entropy-is-decreasing-but-accuracy-remains-the-same-while-training-convolutional-neural-networks-How-can-it-happen) **there can be an issue where the accuracy is the same for two cases, one where the loss is decreasing and the other when the loss is not changing much.**

**Adaptive gradient descent algorithms such as** [**Adagrad**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#AdaGrad)**, Adadelta,** [**RMSprop**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#RMSProp)**,** [**Adam**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_gradient_descent#Adam)**, provide an alternative to classical SGD.**

**These per-parameter learning rate methods provide heuristic approach without requiring expensive work in tuning hyperparameters for the learning rate schedule manually.**

1. **Adagrad performs larger updates for more sparse parameters and smaller updates for less sparse parameter. It has good performance with sparse data and training large-scale neural network. However, its monotonic learning rate usually proves too aggressive and stops learning too early when training deep neural networks.**
2. **Adadelta is an extension of Adagrad that seeks to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.**
3. **RMSprop adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.** 
4. [**Adam**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/adam-optimization-algorithm-for-deep-learning/) **is an update to the RMSProp optimizer which is like RMSprop with momentum.**

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ixb189Iy_Z4PuSCZHn48vmBvRDNchESvmANzapkuTNMt5zYp7vl9NLznUzNQYaMuyUQzhLiQgpCPUho9klBdd4W09dcjsdx8D_yIDvOcOK8Jo2_p6nDMmLv3QL5ohm07-pJmIo48)

**adaptive learning rate methods demonstrate better performance than learning rate schedules, and they require much less effort in hyperparamater settings**

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rYknk8vLbQKYuLSKeItX59a6rdi84U5QaeNJoardmv_jLgXqIMHj1BGbZsMh4l0Pli-mKYg29dNGDMKHS341t94fUScWELjPsIXWy7i1-_zXiCOSR1J46gMODzPQrrX4x64P1ato)

[**Recommended paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.5533v2.pdf)**: practical recommendation for gradient based DNN**

**Another great comparison -** [**pdf paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747) **and** [**webpage link**](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) **-**

* **if your input data is sparse, then you likely achieve the best results using one of the adaptive learning-rate methods.** 
* **An additional benefit is that you will not need to tune the learning rate but will likely achieve the best results with the default value.**
* **In summary, RMSprop is an extension of Adagrad that deals with its radically diminishing learning rates. It is identical to Adadelta, except that Adadelta uses the RMS of parameter updates in the numerator update rule. Adam, finally, adds bias-correction and momentum to RMSprop. Insofar, RMSprop, Adadelta, and Adam are very similar algorithms that do well in similar circumstances. Kingma et al. \[10\] show that its bias-correction helps Adam slightly outperform RMSprop towards the end of optimization as gradients become sparser. Insofar, Adam might be the best overall choice**

## **TRAIN / VAL accuracy in NN**

**The second important quantity to track while training a classifier is the validation/training accuracy. This plot can give you valuable insights into the amount of overfitting in your model:**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/K8KuSlFCGaOO9qihQGVQf3Cckcy5A2V98Tt_OKbscmv-ZmmemEVJFs2V9eeydc8Aa_dk-TXXjsJhiPCD7UAqKcvaMc4xsP0RIJNl0EiZ7ybQ5HsrINup7AYJjSfayQELeOA3WS_-)

* **The gap between the training and validation accuracy indicates the amount of overfitting.** 
* **Two possible cases are shown in the diagram on the left. The blue validation error curve shows very small validation accuracy compared to the training accuracy, indicating strong overfitting \(note, it's possible for the validation accuracy to even start to go down after some point\).** 
* **NOTE: When you see this in practice you probably want to increase regularization:**
  * **stronger L2 weight penalty**
  * **Dropout**
  * **collect more data.**
* **The other possible case is when the validation accuracy tracks the training accuracy fairly well. This case indicates that your model capacity is not high enough: make the model larger by increasing the number of parameters.**

## **INITIALIZERS**

**XAVIER GLOROT:**

[**Why’s Xavier initialization important?**](http://andyljones.tumblr.com/post/110998971763/an-explanation-of-xavier-initialization)

**In short, it helps signals reach deep into the network.**

* **If the weights in a network start too small, then the signal shrinks as it passes through each layer until it’s too tiny to be useful.**
* **If the weights in a network start too large, then the signal grows as it passes through each layer until it’s too massive to be useful.**

**Xavier initialization makes sure the weights are ‘just right’, keeping the signal in a reasonable range of values through many layers.**

**To go any further than this, you’re going to need a small amount of statistics - specifically you need to know about random distributions and their variance.**

[**When to use glorot uniform-over-normal initialization?**](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/13061/when-to-use-he-or-glorot-normal-initialization-over-uniform-init-and-what-are)

**However, i am still not seeing anything empirical that says that glorot surpesses everything else under certain conditions \(**[**except the glorot paper**](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf)**\), most importantly, does it really help in LSTM where the vanishing gradient is ~no longer an issue?**

[**He-et-al Initialization**](https://towardsdatascience.com/random-initialization-for-neural-networks-a-thing-of-the-past-bfcdd806bf9e)

**This method of initializing became famous through a paper submitted in 2015 by He et al, and is similar to Xavier initialization, with the factor multiplied by two. In this method, the weights are initialized keeping in mind the size of the previous layer which helps in attaining a global minimum of the cost function faster and more efficiently.**

**w=np.random.randn\(layer\_size\[l\],layer\_size\[l-1\]\)\*np.sqrt\(2/layer\_size\[l-1\]\)**

## **ACTIVATION FUNCTIONS**

**\(**[**a bunch of observations, seems like a personal list**](http://sentiment-mining.blogspot.co.il/2015/08/the-difference-of-activation-function.html)**\) -**

* **Output layer - linear for regression, softmax for classification**
* **Hidden layers - hyperbolic tangent for shallow networks \(less than 3 hidden layers\), and ReLU for deep networks**

**ReLU - The purpose of ReLU is to introduce non-linearity, since most of the real-world data we would want our network to learn would be nonlinear \(e.g. convolution is a linear operation – element wise matrix multiplication and addition, so we account for nonlinearity by introducing a nonlinear function like ReLU, e.g** [**here**](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/) **- search for ReLU\).**

* **Relu is quite resistant to vanishing gradient & allows for deactivating neurons and for sparsity.**
* **Other nonlinear functions such as tanh or sigmoid can also be used instead of ReLU, but ReLU has been found to perform better in most situations.**
* [**Visual + description of activation functions**](https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0)

## **OPTIMIZERS**

**There are several optimizers, each had his 15 minutes of fame, some optimizers are recommended for CNN, Time Series, etc..**

**There are also what I call ‘experimental’ optimizers, it seems like these pop every now and then, with or without a formal proof. It is recommended to follow the literature and see what are the ‘supposedly’ state of the art optimizers atm.**

[**Adamod**](https://medium.com/@lessw/meet-adamod-a-new-deep-learning-optimizer-with-memory-f01e831b80bd) **deeplearning optimizer with memory**

[**Backstitch**](http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2017_nips_backstitch.pdf) **- September 17 - supposedly an improvement over SGD for speech recognition using DNN. Note: it wasnt tested with other datasets or other network types.**

**\(how does it work?\) take a negative step back, then a positive step forward. I.e., When processing a minibatch, instead of taking a single SGD step, we first take a step with −α times the current learning rate, for α &gt; 0 \(e.g. α = 0.3\), and then a step with 1 + α times the learning rate, with the same minibatch \(and a recomputed gradient\). So we are taking a small negative step, and then a larger positive step. This resulted in quite large improvements – around 10% relative improvement \[37\] – for our best speech recognition DNNs. The recommended hyper parameters are in the paper.**

**Drawbacks: takes twice to train, momentum not implemented or tested, dropout is mandatory for improvement, slow starter.**

## **DROPOUT LAYERS IN KERAS AND GENERAL**

[**A very influential paper about dropout and how beneficial it is - bottom line always use it.**](http://jmlr.org/papers/volume15/srivastava14a/srivastava14a.pdf)

**OPEN QUESTIONs:**

1. **does a dropout layer improve performance even if an lstm layer has dropout or recurrent dropout.**
2. **What is the diff between a separate layer and inside the lstm layer.**
3. **What is the diff in practice and intuitively between drop and recurrentdrop**

[**Dropout layers in keras, or dropout regularization:** ](https://machinelearningmastery.com/dropout-regularization-deep-learning-models-keras/)

* **Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored RANDOMLY during training.** 
* **contribution to the activation of downstream neurons is temporally removed on the forward pass and any weight updates are not applied to the neuron on the backward pass.**
* **As a neural network learns, neuron weights settle into their context within the network.**
* **Weights of neurons are tuned for specific features providing some specialization. Neighboring neurons become to rely on this specialization, which if taken too far can result in a fragile model too specialized to the training data. \(overfitting\)**
* **This reliant on context for a neuron during training is referred to complex co-adaptations.**
* **After dropout, other neurons will have to step in and handle the representation required to make predictions for the missing neurons, which is believed to result in multiple independent internal representations being learned by the network.**
* **Thus, the effect of dropout is that the network becomes less sensitive to the specific weights of neurons.** 
* **This in turn leads to a network with better generalization capability and less likely to overfit the training data.**

[**Another great answer about drop out**](https://www.quora.com/In-Keras-what-is-a-dense-and-a-dropout-layer) **-**

* **as a consequence of the 50% dropout, the neural network will learn different, redundant representations; the network can’t rely on the particular neurons and the combination \(or interaction\) of these to be present.** 
* **Another nice side effect is that training will be faster.**
* **Rules:** 
  * **Dropout is only applied during training,** 
  * **Need to rescale the remaining neuron activations. E.g., if you set 50% of the activations in a given layer to zero, you need to scale up the remaining ones by a factor of 2.** 
  * **if the training has finished, you’d use the complete network for testing \(or in other words, you set the dropout probability to 0\).**

[**Implementation of drop out in keras**](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/18088/convolutional-layer-dropout-layer-in-keras/18098) **is “inverse dropout” - n the Keras implementation, the output values are corrected during training \(by dividing, in addition to randomly dropping out the values\) instead of during testing \(by multiplying\). This is called "inverted dropout".**

**Inverted dropout is functionally equivalent to original dropout \(as per your link to Srivastava's paper\), with a nice feature that the network does not use dropout layers at all during test and prediction. This is explained a little in this** [**Keras issue**](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/issues/3305)**.**

[**Dropout notes and rules of thumb aka “best practice” -** ](http://blog.mrtanke.com/2016/10/09/Keras-Study-Notes-3-Dropout-Regularization-for-Deep-Networks/)

* **dropout value of 20%-50% of neurons with 20% providing a good starting point. \(A probability too low has minimal effect and a value too high results in underlearning by the network.\)**
* **Use a large network for better performance, i.e.,  when dropout is used on a larger network, giving the model more of an opportunity to learn independent representations.**
* **Use dropout on VISIBLE AND HIDDEN. Application of dropout at each layer of the network has shown good results.**
* **Unclear ? Use a large learning rate with decay and a large momentum. Increase your learning rate by a factor of 10 to 100 and use a high momentum value of 0.9 or 0.99.**
* **Unclear ? Constrain the size of network weights. A large learning rate can result in very large network weights. Imposing a constraint on the size of network weights such as max-norm regularization with a size of 4 or 5 has been shown to improve results.**

[**Difference between LSTM ‘dropout’ and ‘recurrent\_dropout’**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44924690/keras-the-difference-between-lstm-dropout-and-lstm-recurrent-dropout) **- vertical vs horizontal.**

**I suggest taking a look at \(the first part of\)** [**this paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.05287.pdf)**. Regular dropout is applied on the inputs and/or the outputs, meaning the vertical arrows from x\_t and to h\_t. In you add it as an argument to your layer, it will mask the inputs; you can add a Dropout layer after your recurrent layer to mask the outputs as well. Recurrent dropout masks \(or "drops"\) the connections between the recurrent units; that would be the horizontal arrows in your picture.**

**This picture is taken from the paper above. On the left, regular dropout on inputs and outputs. On the right, regular dropout PLUS recurrent dropout:**

Regularization mechanisms, such as Dropout and L1/L2 weight regularization, are turned off at testing time.**

**The training loss is the average of the losses over each batch of training data. Because your model is changing over time, the loss over the first batches of an epoch is generally higher than over the last batches. On the other hand, the testing loss for an epoch is computed using the model as it is at the end of the epoch, resulting in a lower loss.**

### **NEURO EVOLUTION \(GA/GP based\)**

**NEAT**

[**NEAT**](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/neat.html) \*\*stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies. It is a method for evolving artificial neural networks with a genetic algorithm.

NEAT implements the idea that it is most effective to start evolution with small, simple networks and allow them to become increasingly complex over generations.\*\*

\*\*That way, just as organisms in nature increased in complexity since the first cell, so do neural networks in NEAT.

This process of continual elaboration allows finding highly sophisticated and complex neural networks.\*\*

[**A great article about NEAT**](http://hunterheidenreich.com/blog/neuroevolution-of-augmenting-topologies/)

**HYPER-NEAT**

[**HyperNEAT**](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/) \*\*computes the connectivity of its neural networks as a function of their geometry.

HyperNEAT is based on a theory of representation that hypothesizes that a good representation for an artificial neural network should be able to describe its pattern of connectivity compactly.\*\*

**The encoding in HyperNEAT, called** [**compositional pattern producing networks**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network)\*\*, is designed to represent patterns with regularities such as symmetry, repetition, and repetition with variationץ

\(WIKI\) **\[**Compositional pattern-producing networks**\]\(**[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional\_pattern-producing\_network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_pattern-producing_network)**\)** \(CPPNs\) are a variation of artificial neural networks \(ANNs\) that have an architecture whose evolution is guided by genetic algorithms\*\*

### **Radial Basis Function Network \(RBFN\)**

**+** [**RBF layer in Keras.**](https://github.com/PetraVidnerova/rbf_keras/blob/master/test.py)

**The** [**RBFN**](http://mccormickml.com/2013/08/15/radial-basis-function-network-rbfn-tutorial/) **approach is more intuitive than the MLP.**

* **An RBFN performs classification by measuring the input’s similarity to examples from the training set.** 
* **Each RBFN neuron stores a “prototype”, which is just one of the examples from the training set.** 
* **When we want to classify a new input, each neuron computes the Euclidean distance between the input and its prototype.** 
* **Roughly speaking, if the input more closely resembles the class A prototypes than the class B prototypes, it is classified as class A.**

### **Bayesian Neural Network \(BNN\)**

[**BNN**](https://eng.uber.com/neural-networks-uncertainty-estimation/) **- \(what is?\)** [**Bayesian neural network \(BNN\)**](http://edwardlib.org/tutorials/bayesian-neural-network) **according to Uber - architecture that more accurately forecasts time series predictions and uncertainty estimations at scale. “how Uber has successfully applied this model to large-scale time series anomaly detection, enabling better accommodate rider demand during high-traffic intervals.”**

**Under the BNN framework, prediction uncertainty can be categorized into three types:**

1. **Model uncertainty captures our ignorance of the model parameters and can be reduced as more samples are collected.** 
2. **model misspecification**
3. **inherent noise captures the uncertainty in the data generation process and is irreducible.** 

**Note: in a series of articles, uber explains about time series and leads to a BNN architecture.**

1. [**Neural networks**](https://eng.uber.com/neural-networks/) **- training on multi-signal raw data, training X and Y are window-based and the window size\(lag\) is determined in advance.**

**Vanilla LSTM did not work properly, therefore an architecture of**

**Regarding point 1: ‘run prediction with dropout 100 times’**

**\*\*\*** [**MEDIUM with code how to do it.**](https://medium.com/hal24k-techblog/how-to-generate-neural-network-confidence-intervals-with-keras-e4c0b78ebbdf)

[**Why do we need a confidence measure when we have a softmax probability layer?**](https://hjweide.github.io/quantifying-uncertainty-in-neural-networks) **The blog post explains, for example, that with a CNN of apples, oranges, cat and dogs, a non related example such as a frog image may influence the network to decide its an apple, therefore we can’t rely on the probability as a confidence measure. The ‘run prediction with dropout 100 times’ should give us a confidence measure because it draws each weight from a bernoulli distribution.**

**“By applying dropout to all the weight layers in a neural network, we are essentially drawing each weight from a** [**Bernoulli distribution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution)**. In practice, this mean that we can sample from the distribution by running several forward passes through the network. This is referred to as** [**Monte Carlo dropout**](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02158)**.”**

**Taken from Yarin Gal’s** [**blog post**](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_3d801aa532c1ce.html) **. In this figure we see how sporadic is the signal from a forward pass \(black line\) compared to a much cleaner signal from 100 dropout passes.**

**Is it applicable for time series? In the figure below he tried to predict the missing signal between each two dotted lines, A is a bad estimation, but with a dropout layer we can see that in most cases the signal is better predicted.**

**Old note:** [**The idea behind uncertainty is \(**](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/yarin/blog_3d801aa532c1ce.html)[**paper here**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02142.pdf)**\) that in order to trust your network’s classification, you drop some of the neurons during prediction, you do this ~100 times and you average the results. Intuitively this will give you confidence in your classification and increase your classification accuracy, because only a partial part of your network participated in the classification, randomly, 100 times. Please note that Softmax doesn't give you certainty.**

### **CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NET**

**\(**[**an excellent and thorough explanation about LeNet**](https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/)**\) -**

* **Convolution Layer primary purpose is to extract features from the input image. Convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels by learning image features using small squares of input data.**
* **ReLU \(more in the activation chapter\) - The purpose of ReLU is to introduce non-linearity in our ConvNet**
* **Spatial Pooling \(also called subsampling or downsampling\) reduces the dimensionality of each feature map but retains the most important information. Spatial Pooling can be of different types: Max, Average, Sum etc.**
* **Dense / Fully Connected - a traditional Multi Layer Perceptron that uses a softmax activation function in the output layer to classify. The output from the convolutional and pooling layers represent high-level features of the input image. The purpose of the Fully Connected layer is to use these features for classifying the input image into various classes based on the training dataset.**

**The overall training process of the Convolutional Network may be summarized as below:**

* **Step1: We initialize all filters and parameters / weights with random values**
* **Step2: The network takes a single training image as input, goes through the forward propagation step \(convolution, ReLU and pooling operations along with forward propagation in the Fully Connected layer\) and finds the output probabilities for each class.**
  * **Let's say the output probabilities for the boat image above are \[0.2, 0.4, 0.1, 0.3\]**
  * **Since weights are randomly assigned for the first training example, output probabilities are also random.**
* **Step3: Calculate the total error at the output layer \(summation over all 4 classes\)**
  * **\(L2\) Total Error = ∑  ½ \(target probability – output probability\) ²**
* **Step4: Use Backpropagation to calculate the gradients of the error with respect to all weights in the network and use gradient descent to update all filter values / weights and parameter values to minimize the output error.**
  * **The weights are adjusted in proportion to their contribution to the total error.**
  * **When the same image is input again, output probabilities might now be \[0.1, 0.1, 0.7, 0.1\], which is closer to the target vector \[0, 0, 1, 0\].**
  * **This means that the network has learnt to classify this particular image correctly by adjusting its weights / filters such that the output error is reduced.**
  * **Parameters like number of filters, filter sizes, architecture of the network etc. have all been fixed before Step 1 and do not change during training process – only the values of the filter matrix and connection weights get updated.**
* **Step5: Repeat steps 2-4 with all images in the training set.**

**The above steps train the ConvNet – this essentially means that all the weights and parameters of the ConvNet have now been optimized to correctly classify images from the training set.**

**When a new \(unseen\) image is input into the ConvNet, the network would go through the forward propagation step and output a probability for each class \(for a new image, the output probabilities are calculated using the weights which have been optimized to correctly classify all the previous training examples\). If our training set is large enough, the network will \(hopefully\) generalize well to new images and classify them into correct categories.**

**MAX AVERAGE POOLING**

[**Intuitions to the differences between max and average pooling:**](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/291451/feature-extracted-by-max-pooling-vs-mean-pooling)

1. **A max-pool layer compressed by taking the maximum activation in a block. If you have a block with mostly small activation, but a small bit of large activation, you will loose the information on the low activations. I think of this as saying "this type of feature was detected in this general area".** 
2. **A mean-pool layer compresses by taking the mean activation in a block. If large activations are balanced by negative activations, the overall compressed activations will look like no activation at all. On the other hand, you retain some information about low activations in the previous example.**
3. **MAX pooling In other words: Max pooling roughly means that only those features that are most strongly triggering outputs are used in the subsequent layers. You can look at it a little like focusing the network’s attention on what’s most characteristic for the image at hand.**
4. [**GLOBAL MAX pooling**](https://alexisbcook.github.io/2017/global-average-pooling-layers-for-object-localization/)**: In the last few years, experts have turned to global average pooling \(GAP\) layers to minimize overfitting by reducing the total number of parameters in the model. Similar to max pooling layers, GAP layers are used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a three-dimensional tensor. However, GAP layers perform a more extreme type of dimensionality reduction,**

Cell state is selective memory of the past. The hidden state \(h\) carries the information about what an RNN cell has seen over the time and supply it to the present time such that a loss function is not just dependent upon the data it is seeing in this time instant, but also, data it has seen historically.**

It loops for each time step! I.e., The TimeDistributed achieves this trick by applying the same Dense layer \(same weights\) to the LSTMs outputs for one time step at a time. In this way, the output layer only needs one connection to each LSTM unit \(plus one bias\).**

**A** [**comparison**](https://danijar.com/language-modeling-with-layer-norm-and-gru/) **of LSTM/GRU/MGU with batch normalization and various initializations, GRu/Xavier/Batch are the best and recommended for RNN**

[**Benchmarking LSTM variants**](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/jozefowicz15.pdf)**: - it looks like LSTM and GRU are competitive to mutation \(i believe its only in pytorch\) adding a bias to LSTM works \(a bias of 1 as recommended in the** [**paper**](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1154/0131eae85b2e11d53df7f1360eeb6476e7f4.pdf)**\), but generally speaking there is no conclusive empirical evidence that says one type of network is better than the other for all tests, but the mutated networks tend to win over lstm\gru variants.**

[**BIAS 1 in keras**](https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm) **- unit\_forget\_bias: Boolean.

[**Validation\_split arg**](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-the-validation-split-variable-in-Keras) **- The validation split variable in Keras is a value between \[0..1\]. Keras proportionally split your training set by the value of the variable. The first set is used for training and the 2nd set for validation after each epoch.**

**This is a nice helper add-on by Keras, and most other Keras examples you have seen the training and test set was passed into the fit method, after you have manually made the split. The value of having a validation set is significant and is a vital step to understand how well your model is training. Ideally on a curve you want your training accuracy to be close to your validation curve, and the moment your validation curve falls below your training curve the alarm bells should go off and your model is probably busy over-fitting.**

**Keras is a wonderful framework for deep learning, and there are many different ways of doing things with plenty of helpers.**

**BIDIRECTIONAL LSTM**

**\(what is?\) Wiki - The basic idea of BRNNs is to connect two hidden layers of opposite directions to the same output. By this structure, the output layer can get information from past and future states.**

**BRNN are especially useful when the context of the input is needed. For example, in handwriting recognition, the performance can be enhanced by knowledge of the letters located before and after the current letter.**

[**Another**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/develop-bidirectional-lstm-sequence-classification-python-keras/) **explanation- It involves duplicating the first recurrent layer in the network so that there are now two layers side-by-side, then providing the input sequence as-is as input to the first layer and providing a reversed copy of the input sequence to the second.**

**.. It allows you to specify the merge mode, that is how the forward and backward outputs should be combined before being passed on to the next layer. The options are:**

* **‘sum‘: The outputs are added together.**
* **‘mul‘: The outputs are multiplied together.**
* **‘concat‘: The outputs are concatenated together \(the default\), providing double the number of outputs to the next layer.**
* **‘ave‘: The average of the outputs is taken.**

**The default mode is to concatenate, and this is the method often used in studies of bidirectional LSTMs.**

**GRU**

[**A tutorial about GRU**](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-gru-networks-2ef37df6c9be) **- To solve the vanishing gradient problem of a standard RNN, GRU uses, so called, update gate and reset gate. Basically, these are two vectors which decide what information should be passed to the output. The special thing about them is that they can be trained to keep information from long ago, without washing it through time or remove information which is irrelevant to the prediction.**

1. **update gate helps the model to determine how much of the past information \(from previous time steps\) needs to be passed along to the future.**
2. **Reset gate essentially, this gate is used from the model to decide how much of the past information to forget.**

**Recent interest in graph embedding methods has focused on learning a single representation for each node in the graph. But can nodes really be best described by a single vector representation? In this work, we propose a method for learning multiple representations of the nodes in a graph \(e.g., the users of a social network\). Based on a principled decomposition of the ego-network, each representation encodes the role of the node in a different local community in which the nodes participate. These representations allow for improved reconstruction of the nuanced relationships that occur in the graph a phenomenon that we illustrate through state-of-the-art results on link prediction tasks on a variety of graphs, reducing the error by up to 90%. In addition, we show that these embeddings allow for effective visual analysis of the learned community structure.**

2. [**Lottery ticket on BERT**](https://thegradient.pub/when-bert-plays-the-lottery-all-tickets-are-winning/)**, magnitude vs structured pruning on a various metrics, i.e., LT works on bert. The classical Lottery Ticket Hypothesis was mostly tested with unstructured pruning, specifically magnitude pruning \(m-pruning\) where the weights with the lowest magnitude are pruned irrespective of their position in the model. We iteratively prune 10% of the least magnitude weights across the entire fine-tuned model \(except the embeddings\) and evaluate on dev set, for as long as the performance of the pruned subnetwork is above 90% of the full model.**

**We also experiment with structured pruning \(s-pruning\) of entire components of BERT architecture based on their importance scores: specifically, we 'remove' the least important self-attention heads and MLPs by applying a mask. In each iteration, we prune 10% of BERT heads and 1 MLP, for as long as the performance of the pruned subnetwork is above 90% of the full model. To determine which heads/MLPs to prune, we use a loss-based approximation: the importance scores proposed by** [**Michel, Levy and Neubig \(2019\)**](https://thegradient.pub/when-bert-plays-the-lottery-all-tickets-are-winning/#RefMichel) **for self-attention heads, which we extend to MLPs. Please see our paper and the original formulation for more details.**

1. **Troubleshooting Neural Nets**

**\(**[**37 reasons**](https://blog.slavv.com/37-reasons-why-your-neural-network-is-not-working-4020854bd607?fref=gc&dti=543283492502370)**,** [**10 more**](http://theorangeduck.com/page/neural-network-not-working?utm_campaign=Revue%20newsletter&utm_medium=Newsletter&utm_source=The%20Wild%20Week%20in%20AI&fref=gc&dti=543283492502370)**\) - copy pasted and rewritten here for convenience, it's pretty thorough, but long and extensive, you should have some sort of intuition and not go through all of these. The following list is has much more insight and information in the article itself.**

**The author of the original article suggests to turn everything off and then start building your network step by step, i.e., “a divide and conquer ‘debug’ method”.**

**Dataset Issues**

**1. Check your input data - for stupid mistakes**

**2. Try random input - if the error behaves the same on random data, there is a problem in the net. Debug layer by layer**

**3. Check the data loader - input data is possibly broken. Check the input layer.**

**4. Make sure input is connected to output - do samples have correct labels, even after shuffling?**

**5. Is the relationship between input and output too random? - the input are not sufficiently related to the output. Its pretty amorphic, just look at the data.**

**6. Is there too much noise in the dataset? - badly labelled datasets.**

**7. Shuffle the dataset - useful to counteract order in the DS, always shuffle input and labels together.**

**8. Reduce class imbalance - imbalance datasets may add a bias to class prediction. Balance your class, your loss, do something.**

**9. Do you have enough training examples? - training from scratch? ~1000 images per class, ~probably similar numbers for other types of samples.**

**10. Make sure your batches don’t contain a single label - this is probably something you wont notice and will waste a lot of time figuring out! In certain cases shuffle the DS to prevent batches from having the same label.**

**11. Reduce batch size -** [**This paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04836) **points out that having a very large batch can reduce the generalization ability of the model. However, please note that I found other references that claim a too small batch will impact performance.**

**12. Test on well known Datasets**

**Data Normalization/Augmentation**

**12. Standardize the features - zero mean and unit variance, sounds like normalization.**

**13. Do you have too much data augmentation?**

**Augmentation has a regularizing effect. Too much of this combined with other forms of regularization \(weight L2, dropout, etc.\) can cause the net to underfit.**

**14. Check the preprocessing of your pretrained model - with a pretrained model make sure your input data is similar in range\[0, 1\], \[-1, 1\] or \[0, 255\]?**

**15. Check the preprocessing for train/validation/test set - CS231n points out a** [**common pitfall**](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-2/#datapre)**:**

**Any preprocessing should be computed ONLY on the training data, then applied to val/test**

**Implementation issues**

**16. Try solving a simpler version of the problem -divide and conquer prediction, i.e., class and box coordinates, just use one.**

**17. Look for correct loss “at chance” - calculat loss for chance level, i.e 10% baseline is -ln\(0.1\) = 2.3 Softmax loss is the negative log probability. Afterwards increase regularization strength which should increase the loss.**

**18. Check your custom loss function.**

**19. Verify loss input - parameter confusion.**

**20. Adjust loss weights -If your loss is composed of several smaller loss functions, make sure their magnitude relative to each is correct. This might involve testing different combinations of loss weights.**

**21. Monitor other metrics -like accuracy.**

**22. Test any custom layers, debugging them.**

**23. Check for “frozen” layers or variables - accidentally frozen?**

**24. Increase network size - more layers, more neurons.**

**25. Check for hidden dimension errors - confusion due to vectors -&gt;\(64, 64, 64\)**

**26. Explore Gradient checking -does your backprop work for custon gradients?** [**1**](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/DebuggingGradientChecking/) **\*\*\[**2**\]\(**[http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/\#gradcheck](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#gradcheck)**\) \*\***[**3**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/Y3s6r/gradient-checking)**.**

**Training issues**

**27. Solve for a really small dataset - can you generalize on 2 samples?**

**28. Check weights initialization -** [**Xavier**](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf) **or** [**He**](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/He_Delving_Deep_into_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf) **or forget about it for networks such as RNN.**

**29. Change your hyperparameters - grid search**

**30. Reduce regularization - too much may underfit, try for dropout, batch norm, weight, bias , L2.**

**31. Give it more training time as long as the loss is decreasing.**

**32. Switch from Train to Test mode - not clear.**

**33. Visualize the training - activations, weights, layer updates, biases.** [**Tensorboard**](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/summaries_and_tensorboard) **and** [**Crayon**](https://github.com/torrvision/crayon)**. Tips on** [**Deeplearning4j**](https://deeplearning4j.org/visualization#usingui)**. Expect gaussian distribution for weights, biases start at 0 and end up almost gaussian. Keep an eye out for parameters that are diverging to +/- infinity. Keep an eye out for biases that become very large. This can sometimes occur in the output layer for classification if the distribution of classes is very imbalanced.**

**34. Try a different optimizer, Check this** [**excellent post**](http://ruder.io/optimizing-gradient-descent/) **about gradient descent optimizers.**

**35. Exploding / Vanishing gradients - Gradient clipping may help. Tips on:** [**Deeplearning4j**](https://deeplearning4j.org/visualization#usingui)**: “A good standard deviation for the activations is on the order of 0.5 to 2.0. Significantly outside of this range may indicate vanishing or exploding activations.”**

**36. Increase/Decrease Learning Rate, or use adaptive learning**

**37. Overcoming NaNs, big issue for RNN - decrease LR,** [**how to deal with NaNs**](http://russellsstewart.com/notes/0.html)**. evaluate layer by layer, why does it appear.**

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT representations can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks.\*\* ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/anFY63RxhdYt82bb_XUGDLRUmj2vuR1I0iJye66cOqgC2gQegXVf2ibkC64LRPIfgUj8Brl7VYUFfxw3gG0KBnwTuqJ2NCohd6mi9YzCkZmHGuDz1QxXl7JUtMv5BpiBJXGnC-Zc)

NOTE: Unlike the other methods, skip-thought vectors require the sentences to be ordered in a semantically meaningful way. This makes this method difficult to use for domains such as social media text, where each snippet of text exists in isolation.\*\*
13. [**Fastsent**](http://mlexplained.com/2017/12/28/an-overview-of-sentence-embedding-methods/) **- Skip-thought vectors are slow to train. FastSent attempts to remedy this inefficiency while expanding on the core idea of skip-thought: that predicting surrounding sentences is a powerful way to obtain distributed representations. Formally, FastSent represents sentences as the simple sum of its word embeddings, making training efficient. The word embeddings are learned so that the inner product between the sentence embedding and the word embeddings of surrounding sentences is maximized. NOTE: FastSent sacrifices word order for the sake of efficiency, which can be a large disadvantage depending on the use-case.**

15. [**Infersent by facebook**](https://github.com/facebookresearch/InferSent) **-** [**paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02364)  **InferSent is a sentence embeddings method that provides semantic representations for English sentences. It is trained on natural language inference data and generalizes well to many different tasks. ABSTRACT: we show how universal sentence representations trained using the supervised data of the Stanford Natural Language Inference datasets can consistently outperform unsupervised methods like SkipThought vectors on a wide range of transfer tasks.

With negative sampling, we are instead going to randomly select just a small number of “negative” words \(let’s say 5\) to update the weights for. \(In this context, a “negative” word is one for which we want the network to output a 0 for\). We will also still update the weights for our “positive” word \(which is the word “quick” in our current example\). The “negative samples” \(that is, the 5 output words that we’ll train to output 0\) are chosen using a “unigram distribution”. Essentially, the probability for selecting a word as a negative sample is related to its frequency, with more frequent words being more likely to be selected as negative samples.\*\*

Instead of extracting the embeddings from a neural network that is designed to perform a surrogate task \(predicting neighbouring words\), the embeddings are optimized directly so that the dot product of two word vectors equals the log of the number of times the two words will occur near each other \(within 5 words for example\). For example if "dog" and "cat" occur near each other 10 times in a corpus, then vec\(dog\) dot vec\(cat\) = log\(10\). This forces the vectors to somehow encode the frequency distribution of which words occur near them.”**

1. [**Do attention heads in bert roberta track syntactic dependencies?**](https://medium.com/@phu_pmh/do-attention-heads-in-bert-track-syntactic-dependencies-81c8a9be311a) **- tl;dr: The attention weights between tokens in BERT/RoBERTa bear similarity to some syntactic dependency relations, but the results are less conclusive than we’d like as they don’t significantly outperform linguistically uninformed baselines for all types of dependency relations. In the case of MAX, our results indicate that specific heads in the BERT models may correspond to certain dependency relations, whereas for MST, we find much less support “generalist” heads whose attention weights correspond to a full syntactic dependency structure.**

**In both cases, the metrics do not appear to be representative of the extent of linguistic knowledge learned by the BERT models, based on their strong performance on many NLP tasks. Hence, our takeaway is that while we can tease out some structure from the attention weights of BERT models using the above methods, studying the attention weights alone is unlikely to give us the full picture of BERT’s strength processing natural language.**

13. [**Adaptive sparse transformers**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00015) **- This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with**

**α-entmax -- allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets.**

**Pruning - Removes unnecessary parts of the network after training. This includes weight magnitude pruning, attention head pruning, layers, and others. Some methods also impose regularization during training to increase prunability \(layer dropout\).**

**Weight Factorization - Approximates parameter matrices by factorizing them into a multiplication of two smaller matrices. This imposes a low-rank constraint on the matrix. Weight factorization can be applied to both token embeddings \(which saves a lot of memory on disk\) or parameters in feed-forward / self-attention layers \(for some speed improvements\).**

**Knowledge Distillation - Aka “Student Teacher.” Trains a much smaller Transformer from scratch on the pre-training / downstream-data. Normally this would fail, but utilizing soft labels from a fully-sized model improves optimization for unknown reasons. Some methods also distill BERT into different architectures \(LSTMS, etc.\) which have faster inference times. Others dig deeper into the teacher, looking not just at the output but at weight matrices and hidden activations.**

**Weight Sharing - Some weights in the model share the same value as other parameters in the model. For example, ALBERT uses the same weight matrices for every single layer of self-attention in BERT.**

**Quantization - Truncates floating point numbers to only use a few bits \(which causes round-off error\). The quantization values can also be learned either during or after training.**

**Pre-train vs. Downstream - Some methods only compress BERT w.r.t. certain downstream tasks. Others compress BERT in a way that is task-agnostic.**

For example, we find heads that attend to the direct objects of verbs, determiners of nouns, objects of prepositions, and coreferent mentions with remarkably high accuracy. Lastly, we propose an attention-based probing classifier and use it to further demonstrate that substantial syntactic information is captured in BERT’s attention**

**Label flipping is a training technique where one selectively manipulates the labels in order to make the model more robust against label noise and associated attacks - the specifics depend a lot on the nature of the noise. Label flipping bears no benefit only under the assumption that all labels are \(and will always be\) correct and that no adversaries exist. In cases where noise tolerance is desirable, training with label flipping is beneficial.**

**Label smoothing is a regularization technique \(and then some\) aimed at improving model performance. Its effect takes place irrespective of label correctness.**

1. [ **Paper: when does label smoothing helps?**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.02629) **Smoothing the labels in this way prevents the network from becoming overconfident and label smoothing has been used in many state-of-the-art models, including image classification, language translation and speech recognition...Here we show empirically that in addition to improving generalization, label smoothing improves model calibration which can significantly improve beam-search. However, we also observe that if a teacher network is trained with label smoothing, knowledge distillation into a student network is much less effective.**

We address the problem of label flips attack where an adversary contaminates the training set through flipping labels. By analyzing the objective of the adversary, we formulate an optimization framework for finding the label flips that maximize the classification error. An algorithm for attacking support vector machines is derived. Experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of classifiers is significantly degraded under the attack.**

A successful approach to SSL is to learn representations which are invariant to distortions of the input sample. However, a recurring issue with this approach is the existence of trivial constant solutions. Most current methods avoid such solutions by careful implementation details. We propose an objective function that naturally avoids such collapse by measuring the cross-correlation matrix between the outputs of two identical networks fed with distorted versions of a sample, and making it as close to the identity matrix as possible. This causes the representation vectors of distorted versions of a sample to be similar, while minimizing the redundancy between the components of these vectors.**
