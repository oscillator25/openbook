# Genetic Algorithms & Genetic Programming

[**What is the difference?**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3819977/what-are-the-differences-between-genetic-algorithms-and-genetic-programming) **Genetic programming and genetic algorithms are very similar. They are both used to evolve the answer to a problem, by comparing the fitness of each candidate in a population of potential candidates over many generations.**

**Each generation, new candidates are found by randomly changing \(mutation\) or swapping parts \(crossover\) of other candidates. The least 'fit' candidates are removed from the population. - peterjwest**

**Genetic algorithms \(GA\) are search algorithms that mimic the process of natural evolution, where each individual is a candidate solution: individuals are generally "raw data" \(in whatever encoding format has been defined\).**

**Genetic programming \(GP\) is considered a special case of GA, where each individual is a computer program \(not just "raw data"\). GP explore the algorithmic search space and evolve computer programs to perform a defined task.**
