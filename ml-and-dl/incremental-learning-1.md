   1. this article has a very nice trick in adding a reward component to the loss function in order to mitigate for unbalanced class label problem, instead of the usual balancing.

## **Q-LEARN**

* **Markov chain problem, \(state, action, new state, reward\)**
* **Lots of Exploration in the beginning, then exploitation** 
* **Returns optimal policy.**
