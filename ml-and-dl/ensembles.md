## [**Ensembles in WEKA**](http://machinelearningmastery.com/use-ensemble-machine-learning-algorithms-weka/) _\*\*_

**- bagging \(random sample selection, multi classifier training\), random forest \(random feature selection for each tree, multi tree training\), boosting\(creating stumps, each new stump tries to fix the previous error, at last combining results using new data, each model is assigned a skill weight and accounted for in the end\), voting\(majority vote, any set of algorithms within weka, results combined via mean or some other way\), stacking\(same as voting but combining predictions using a meta model is used\).**

## **BAGGING - bootstrap aggregating**

[**Bagging**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Mg8QD0F1dQ&list=PLAwxTw4SYaPnIRwl6rad_mYwEk4Gmj7Mx&index=192) **- best example so far, create m bags, put n’&lt;n samples \(60% of n\) in each bag - with replacement which means that the same sample can be selected twice or more, query from the test \(x\) each of the m models, calculate mean, this is the classification.**

**Overfitting - not an issue with bagging, as the mean of the models actually averages or smoothes the “curves”. Even if all of them are overfitted.**

## **BOOSTING**

**Mastery on using** [**all the boosting algorithms**](https://machinelearningmastery.com/gradient-boosting-with-scikit-learn-xgboost-lightgbm-and-catboost/?fbclid=IwAR1wenJZ52kU5RZUgxHE4fj4M9Ods1p10EBh5J4QdLSSq2XQmC4s9Se98Sg)**: Gradient Boosting with Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost**

**Adaboost: similar to bagging, create a system that chooses from samples that were modelled poorly before.**

1. **create bag\_1 with n’ features &lt;n with replacement, create the model\_1, test on ALL train.**
2. **Create bag\_2 with n’ features with replacement, but add a bias for selecting from the samples that were wrongly classified by the model\_1. Create a model\_2. Average results from model\_1 and model\_2. I.e., who was classified correctly or not.**
3. **Create bag\_3 with n’ features with replacement, but add a bias for selecting from the samples that were wrongly classified by the model\_1+2. Create a model\_3. Average results from model\_1, 2 & 3 I.e., who was classified correctly or not. Iterate onward.**
4. **Create bag\_m with n’ features with replacement, but add a bias for selecting from the samples that were wrongly classified by the previous steps.**
