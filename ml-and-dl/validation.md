### **DATASETS RELIABILITY & CORRECTNESS** 

**1.** [**Clever Hans effect**](https://thegradient.pub/nlps-clever-hans-moment-has-arrived/?fbclid=IwAR3vSx9EjXcSPhXU3Jyf7aWpTqhbVDARnh3qGpSw0rysv9rLeGyZFFCPnJA) **- in relations to cues left in the dataset that models find, instead of actually solving the defined task!**

* **Ablating, i.e. removing, part of a model and observing the impact this has on performance is a common method for verifying that the part in question is useful. If performance doesn't go down, then the part is useless and should be removed. Carrying this method over to datasets, it should become common practice to perform dataset ablations, as well, for example:**
* **Provide only incomplete input \(as done in the reviewed paper\): This verifies that the complete input is required. If not, the dataset contains cues that allow taking shortcuts.**
* **Shuffle the input: This verifies the importance of word \(or sentence\) order. If a bag-of-words/sentences gives similar results, even though the task requires sequential reasoning, then the model has not learned sequential reasoning and the dataset contains cues that allow the model to "solve" the task without it.**
* **Assign random labels: How much does performance drop if ten percent of instances are relabeled randomly? How much with all random labels? If scores don't change much, the model probably didn't learning anything interesting about the task.**
* **Randomly replace content words: How much does performance drop if all noun phrases and/or verb phrases are replaced with random noun phrases and verbs? If not much, the dataset may provide unintended non-content cues, such as sentence length or distribution of function words.**

### **FAIRNESS, ACCOUNTABILITY & TRANSPARENCY ML**

1. **FATML** [**website**](https://www.fatml.org/) **- The past few years have seen growing recognition that machine learning raises novel challenges for ensuring non-discrimination, due process, and understandability in decision-making. In particular, policymakers, regulators, and advocates have expressed fears about the potentially discriminatory impact of machine learning, with many calling for further technical research into the dangers of inadvertently encoding bias into automated decisions.**

**At the same time, there is increasing alarm that the complexity of machine learning may reduce the justification for consequential decisions to “the algorithm made me do it.”**

[**Poisoning attacks on fairness**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07401.pdf) **- Research in adversarial machine learning has shown how the performance of machine learning models can be seriously compromised by injecting even a small fraction of poisoning points into the training data. We empirically show that our attack is effective not only in the white-box setting, in which the attacker has full access to the target model, but also in a more challenging black-box scenario in which the attacks are optimized against a substitute model and then transferred to the target model**

In this article, we investigate these questions using image classification networks as a case study. We discuss several different ways to choose a baseline input and the assumptions that are implicit in each baseline. Although we focus here on path attribution methods, our discussion of baselines is closely connected with the concept of missingness in the feature space - a concept that is critical to interpretability research.**

There is a way forward -- it is to design models that are inherently interpretable. This manuscript clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications where interpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare, and computer vision.”**

The implication is that decisions of classifiers trained on textual data are not agnostic to -- and likely condition on -- demographic attributes. “ “we explore several techniques to improve the effectiveness of the adversarial component. Our main conclusion is a cautionary one: do not rely on the adversarial training to achieve invariant representation to sensitive features.”**

[**Null It Out: Guarding Protected Attributes by Iterative Nullspace Projection**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07667) **\(paper\) ,** [**github**](https://github.com/shauli-ravfogel/nullspace_projection)**,** [**presentation**](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Xi5HLpvvRE8BqcNBZMyPS4gBa0i0lqZvRebz-AZxAPA/edit) **by Shauli et al. - removing biased information such as gender from an embedding space using nullspace projection. The objective is this: give a representation of text, for example BERT embeddings of many resumes/CVs, we want to achieve a state where a certain quality, for example a gender representation of the person who wrote this resume is not encoded in X. they used the light version definition for “not encoded”, i.e., you cant predict the quality from the representation with a higher than random score, using a linear model. I.e., every linear model you will train, will not be able to predict the person’s gender out of the embedding space and will reach a 50% accuracy. This is done by an iterative process that includes. 1. Linear model training to predict the quality of the concept from the representation. 2. Performing ‘projection to null space’ for the linear classifier, this is an acceptable linear algebra calculation that has a meaning of zeroing the representation from the projection on the separation place that the linear model is representing, making the model useless. I.e., it will always predict the zero vector. This is done iteratively on the neutralized output, i.e., in the second iteration we look for an alternative way to predict the gender out of X, until we reach 50% accuracy \(or some other metric you want to measure\) at this point we have neutralized all the linear directions in the embedding space, that were predictive to the gender of the author.**

**For a matrix W, the null space is a sub-space of all X such that WX=0, i.e., W maps X to the zero vector, this is a linear projection of the zero vector into a subspace. For example you can take a 3d vectors and calculate its projection on XY.**

1. **Can we extinct predictive samples? Its an open question, Maybe we can use influence functions?**

[**Understanding Black-box Predictions via Influence Functions**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04730.pdf) **- How can we explain the predictions of a blackbox model? In this paper, we use influence functions — a classic technique from robust statistics — to trace a model’s prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction.**

**We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually indistinguishable training-set attacks.**

### **DIFFERENTIAL PRIVACY**

1. [**Differential privacy**](https://georgianpartners.com/what-is-differential-privacy/) **has emerged as a major area of research in the effort to prevent the identification of individuals and private data. It is a mathematical definition for the privacy loss that results to individuals when their private information is used to create AI products. It works by injecting noise into a dataset, during a machine learning training process, or into the output of a machine learning model, without introducing significant adverse effects on data analysis or model performance. It achieves this by calibrating the noise level to the sensitivity of the algorithm. The result is a differentially private dataset or model that cannot be reverse engineered by an attacker, while still providing useful information. Uses BOTLON & EPSILON**
