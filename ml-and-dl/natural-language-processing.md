## **TF-IDF**

[**TF-IDF**](http://www.tfidf.com/) **- how important is a word to a document in a corpus**

**TF\(t\) = \(Number of times term t appears in a document\) / \(Total number of terms in the document\).**

**Frequency of word in doc / all words in document \(normalized bcz docs have diff sizes\)**

**IDF\(t\) = log\_e\(Total number of documents / Number of documents with term t in it\).**

**measures how important a term is**

**TF-IDF is TF\*IDF**

**Phrase modelling**

1. [**Phrase Modeling**](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/conference_notebooks/modern_nlp_in_python.ipynb) **- using gensim and spacy**

**Phrase modeling is another approach to learning combinations of tokens that together represent meaningful multi-word concepts. We can develop phrase models by looping over the the words in our reviews and looking for words that co-occur \(i.e., appear one after another\) together much more frequently than you would expect them to by random chance. The formula our phrase models will use to determine whether two tokens AA and BB constitute a phrase is:**

**count\(A B\)−countmincount\(A\)∗count\(B\)∗N&gt;threshold**

   2. [**Medium**](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-snorkel-27e4b0e6ecff)
2.

   1. **Yes, the Snorkel project has included work before on hierarchical labeling scenarios. The main papers detailing our results include the DEEM workshop paper you referenced \(**[**https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3209889.3209898**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3209889.3209898)**\) and the more complete paper presented at AAAI \(**[**https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02840**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02840)**\). Before the Snorkel and Snorkel MeTaL projects were merged in Snorkel v0.9, the Snorkel MeTaL project included an interface for explicitly specifying hierarchies between tasks which was utilized by the label model and could be used to automatically compile a multi-task end model as well \(demo here:** [**https://github.com/HazyResearch/metal/blob/master/tutorials/Multitask.ipynb**](https://github.com/HazyResearch/metal/blob/master/tutorials/Multitask.ipynb)**\). That interface is not currently available in Snorkel v0.9 \(no fundamental blockers; just hasn't been ported over yet\).**
   2. **There are, however, still a number of ways to model such situations. One way is to treat each node in the hierarchy as a separate task and combine their probabilities post-hoc \(e.g., P\(credit-request\) = P\(billing\) \* P\(credit-request \| billing\)\). Another is to treat them as separate tasks and use a multi-task end model to implicitly learn how the predictions of some tasks should affect the predictions of others \(e.g., the end model we use in the AAAI paper\). A third option is to create a single task with all the leaf categories and modify the output space of the LFs you were considering for the higher nodes \(the deeper your hierarchy is or the larger the number of classes, the less apppealing this is w/r/t to approaches 1 and 2\).**

3. **Find a nearest neighbor for out optimal set of keywords per “category,** 
4. **For a group of keywords, find their knn neighbors in w2v-space, alternatively find k clusters in w2v space that has those keywords. For a new word/mean sentence vector in the ‘category’ find the minimal distance to the new cluster \(either one of approaches\) and this is new annotation.**

### [**7 myths of annotation**](https://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/viewFile/2564/2468)

1. **Myth One: One Truth Most data collection efforts assume that there is one correct interpretation for every input example.** 
2. **Myth Two: Disagreement Is Bad To increase the quality of annotation data, disagreement among the annotators should be avoided or reduced.** 
3. **Myth Three: Detailed Guidelines Help When specific cases continuously cause disagreement, more instructions are added to limit interpretations.** 
4. **Myth Four: One Is Enough Most annotated examples are evaluated by one person.** 
5. **Myth Five: Experts Are Better Human annotators with domain knowledge provide better annotated data.** 
6. **Myth Six: All Examples Are Created Equal The mathematics of using ground truth treats every example the same; either you match the correct result or not.** 
7. **Myth Seven: Once Done, Forever Valid Once human annotated data is collected for a task, it is used over and over with no update. New annotated data is not aligned with previous data.**

**The Kappa statistic varies from 0 to 1, where.**

* **0 = agreement equivalent to chance.**
* **0.1 – 0.20 = slight agreement.**
* **0.21 – 0.40 = fair agreement.**
* **0.41 – 0.60 = moderate agreement.**
* **0.61 – 0.80 = substantial agreement.**
* **0.81 – 0.99 = near perfect agreement**
* **1 = perfect agreement.**
* **Fleiss’ kappa, from 3 people and above.**

**Kappa ranges from 0 to 1, where:**

* **0 is no agreement \(or agreement that you would expect to find by chance\),**
* **1 is perfect agreement.**
* **Fleiss’s Kappa is an extension of Cohen’s kappa for three raters or more. In addition, the assumption with Cohen’s kappa is that your raters are deliberately chosen and fixed. With Fleiss’ kappa, the assumption is that your raters were chosen at random from a larger population.**

* **Values range from 0 to 1, where 0 is perfect disagreement and 1 is perfect agreement. Krippendorff suggests: “\[I\]t is customary to require α ≥ .800. Where tentative conclusions are still acceptable, α ≥ .667 is the lowest conceivable limit \(2004, p. 241\).”**

### **Ground Truth**

1. **For sentiment In Vader -** 
   1. **“Screening for English language reading comprehension – each rater had to individually score an 80% or higher on a standardized college-level reading comprehension test.** 
   2. **Complete an online sentiment rating training and orientation session, and score 90% or higher for matching the known \(prevalidated\) mean sentiment rating of lexical items which included individual words, emoticons, acronyms, sentences, tweets, and text snippets \(e.g., sentence segments, or phrases\).** 
   3. **Every batch of 25 features contained five “golden items” with a known \(pre-validated\) sentiment rating distribution. If a worker was more than one standard deviation away from the mean of this known distribution on three or more of the five golden items, we discarded all 25 ratings in the batch from this worker.** 
   4. **Bonus to incentivize and reward the highest quality work. Asked workers to select the valence score that they thought “most other people” would choose for the given lexical feature \(early/iterative pilot testing revealed that wording the instructions in this manner garnered a much tighter standard deviation without significantly affecting the mean sentiment rating, allowing us to achieve higher quality \(generalized\) results while being more economical\).** 
   5. **Compensated AMT workers $0.25 for each batch of 25 items they rated, with an additional $0.25 incentive bonus for all workers who successfully matched the group mean \(within 1.5 standard deviations\) on at least 20 of 25 responses in each batch. Using these four quality control methods, we achieved remarkable value in the data obtained from our AMT workers – we paid incentive bonuses for high quality to at least 90% of raters for most batches.**

* **13 languages**
* **Evaluated 6 pretrained classification models**
* **10 CFV**
* **SVM / NB**
* **Annotator agreements.** 
  * **about 15% were intentionally duplicated to be annotated twice,**
  * **by the same annotator** 
  * **by two different annotators** 
* **Self-agreement from multiple annotations of the same annotator**
* **Inter-agreement from multiple annotations by different annotators** 
* **The confidence intervals for the agreements are estimated by bootstrapping \[**[**12**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0155036#pone.0155036.ref012)**\].** 
* **It turns out that the self-agreement is a good measure to identify low quality annotators,** 
* **the inter-annotator agreement provides a good estimate of the objective difficulty of the task, unless it is too low.**

**Alpha was developed to measure the agreement between human annotators, but can also be used to measure the agreement between classification models and a gold standard. It generalizes several specialized agreement measures, takes ordering of classes into account, and accounts for the agreement by chance. Alpha is defined as follows:**

**LDA is already taken by the above algorithm!**

[**Latent Dirichlet allocation \(LDA\) -**](https://algorithmia.com/algorithms/nlp/LDA) **This algorithm takes a group of documents \(anything that is made of up text\), and returns a number of topics \(which are made up of a number of words\) most relevant to these documents.**

  * [**LDA is a probabilistic**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40171208/scikit-learn-should-i-fit-model-with-tf-or-tf-idf) **generative model that generates documents by sampling a topic for each word and then a word from the sampled topic. The generated document is represented as a bag of words.**
  * **NMF is in its general definition the search for 2 matrices W and H such that W\*H=V where V is an observed matrix. The only requirement for those matrices is that all their elements must be non negative.**
  * **From the above definitions it is clear that in LDA only bag of words frequency counts can be used since a vector of reals makes no sense. Did we create a word 1.2 times? On the other hand we can use any non negative representation for NMF and in the example tf-idf is used.**
  * **As far as choosing the number of iterations, for the NMF in scikit learn I don't know the stopping criterion although I believe it is the relative improvement of the loss function being smaller than a threshold so you 'll have to experiment. For LDA I suggest checking manually the improvement of the log likelihood in a held out validation set and stopping when it falls under a threshold.**
  * **The rest of the parameters depend heavily on the data so I suggest, as suggested by @rpd, that you do a parameter search.**
  * **So to sum up, LDA can only generate frequencies and NMF can generate any non negative matrix.**

  1. **Text classification – Topic modeling can improve classification by grouping similar words together in topics rather than using each word as a feature**
  2. **Recommender Systems – Using a similarity measure we can build recommender systems. If our system would recommend articles for readers, it will recommend articles with a topic structure similar to the articles the user has already read.**
  3. **Uncovering Themes in Texts – Useful for detecting trends in online publications for example**
  4. **A Form of Tagging - If document classification is assigning a single category to a text, topic modeling is assigning multiple tags to a text. A human expert can label the resulting topics with human-readable labels and use different heuristics to convert the weighted topics to a set of tags.**
  5. [**Topic Modelling for Feature Selection**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/beginners-guide-to-topic-modeling-in-python/) **- Sometimes LDA can also be used as feature selection technique. Take an example of text classification problem where the training data contain category wise documents. If LDA is running on sets of category wise documents. Followed by removing common topic terms across the results of different categories will give the best features for a category.**
  6. 

**How to interpret topics using pyldaviz:**

**Let’s interpret the topic visualization. Notice how topics are shown on the left while words are on the right. Here are the main things you should consider:**

1. **Larger topics are more frequent in the corpus.**
2. **Topics closer together are more similar, topics further apart are less similar.**
3. **When you select a topic, you can see the most representative words for the selected topic. This measure can be a combination of how frequent or how discriminant the word is. You can adjust the weight of each property using the slider.**
4. **Hovering over a word will adjust the topic sizes according to how representative the word is for the topic.**

**\*\*\*\***[**pyLDAviz paper\*\*\*!**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LDAvis/vignettes/details.pdf)

[**pyLDAviz - what am i looking at ?**](https://github.com/explosion/spacy-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/conference_notebooks/modern_nlp_in_python.ipynb) **by spacy**

**There are a lot of moving parts in the visualization. Here's a brief summary:**

* **On the left, there is a plot of the "distance" between all of the topics \(labeled as the Intertopic Distance Map\)**
  * **The plot is rendered in two dimensions according a** [**multidimensional scaling \(MDS\)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling) **algorithm. Topics that are generally similar should be appear close together on the plot, while dissimilar topics should appear far apart.**
  * **The relative size of a topic's circle in the plot corresponds to the relative frequency of the topic in the corpus.**
  * **An individual topic may be selected for closer scrutiny by clicking on its circle, or entering its number in the "selected topic" box in the upper-left.**
* **On the right, there is a bar chart showing top terms.**
  * **When no topic is selected in the plot on the left, the bar chart shows the top-30 most "salient" terms in the corpus. A term's saliency is a measure of both how frequent the term is in the corpus and how "distinctive" it is in distinguishing between different topics.**
  * **When a particular topic is selected, the bar chart changes to show the top-30 most "relevant" terms for the selected topic. The relevance metric is controlled by the parameter λλ, which can be adjusted with a slider above the bar chart.**
    * **Setting the λλ parameter close to 1.0 \(the default\) will rank the terms solely according to their probability within the topic.**
    * **Setting λλ close to 0.0 will rank the terms solely according to their "distinctiveness" or "exclusivity" within the topic — i.e., terms that occur only in this topic, and do not occur in other topics.**
    * **Setting λλ to values between 0.0 and 1.0 will result in an intermediate ranking, weighting term probability and exclusivity accordingly.**
* **Rolling the mouse over a term in the bar chart on the right will cause the topic circles to resize in the plot on the left, to show the strength of the relationship between the topics and the selected term.**

**A more detailed explanation of the pyLDAvis visualization can be found** [**here**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LDAvis/vignettes/details.pdf)**. Unfortunately, though the data used by gensim and pyLDAvis are the same, they don't use the same ID numbers for topics. If you need to match up topics in gensim's LdaMulticore object and pyLDAvis' visualization, you have to dig through the terms manually.**

1. [**Another great article about LDA**](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/beginners-guide-to-topic-modeling-in-python/)**, including algorithm, parameters!! And**

**Parameters of LDA**

1. **Alpha and Beta Hyperparameters – alpha represents document-topic density and Beta represents topic-word density. Higher the value of alpha, documents are composed of more topics and lower the value of alpha, documents contain fewer topics. On the other hand, higher the beta, topics are composed of a large number of words in the corpus, and with the lower value of beta, they are composed of few words.**
2. **Number of Topics – Number of topics to be extracted from the corpus. Researchers have developed approaches to obtain an optimal number of topics by using Kullback Leibler Divergence Score. I will not discuss this in detail, as it is too mathematical. For understanding, one can refer to this\[1\] original paper on the use of KL divergence.**
3. **Number of Topic Terms – Number of terms composed in a single topic. It is generally decided according to the requirement. If the problem statement talks about extracting themes or concepts, it is recommended to choose a higher number, if problem statement talks about extracting features or terms, a low number is recommended.**
4. **Number of Iterations / passes – Maximum number of iterations allowed to LDA algorithm for convergence.**

**Ways to improve LDA:**

1. **Reduce dimentionality of document-term matrix**
2. **Frequency filter**
3. **POS filter**
4. **Batch wise LDA**

   1. [**The default for alpha is 5.**](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44561609/how-does-mallet-set-its-default-hyperparameters-for-lda-i-e-alpha-and-beta)**0 divided by the number of topics. You can think of this as five "pseudo-words" of weight on the uniform distribution over topics. If the document is short, we expect to stay closer to the uniform prior. If the document is long, we would feel more confident moving away from the prior.**
   2. **With hyperparameter optimization, the alpha value for each topic can be different. They usually become smaller than the default setting.**
   3. **The default value for beta is 0.01. This means that each topic has a weight on the uniform prior equal to the size of the vocabulary divided by 100. This seems to be a good value. With optimization turned on, the value rarely changes by more than a factor of two.**

Topics are not guaranteed to be well interpretable, therefore, coherence measures have been proposed to distinguish between good and bad topics. Studies of topic coherence so far are limited to measures that score pairs of individual words. For the first time, we include coherence measures from scientific philosophy that score pairs of more complex word subsets and apply them to topic scoring.**

**Conclusion: The results of the first experiment show that if we are using the one-any, any-any and one-all coherences directly for optimization they are leading to meaningful word sets. The second experiment shows that these coherence measures are able to outperform the UCI coherence as well as the UMass coherence on these generated word sets. For evaluating LDA topics any-any and one-any coherences perform slightly better than the UCI coherence. The correlation of the UMass coherence and the human ratings is not as high as for the other coherences.**

1. **Code:** [**Evaluating topic coherence, using gensim umass or cv parameter**](https://datascienceplus.com/evaluation-of-topic-modeling-topic-coherence/) **- To conclude, there are many other approaches to evaluate Topic models such as Perplexity, but its poor indicator of the quality of the topics.Topic Visualization is also a good way to assess topic models. Topic Coherence measure is a good way to compare difference topic models based on their human-interpretability.The u\_mass and c\_v topic coherences capture the optimal number of topics by giving the interpretability of these topics a number called coherence score.**

[**Word based vs char based**](https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/13138/what-is-the-difference-between-word-based-and-char-based-text-generation-rnns) **- Word-based LMs display higher accuracy and lower computational cost than char-based LMs. However, char-based RNN LMs better model languages with a rich morphology such as Finish, Turkish, Russian etc. Using word-based RNN LMs to model such languages is difficult if possible at all and is not advised. Char-based RNN LMs can mimic grammatically correct sequences for a wide range of languages, require bigger hidden layer and computationally more expensive while word-based RNN LMs train faster and generate more coherent texts and yet even these generated texts are far from making actual sense.**

**Full results for every language that I tested are in table at the end of blog post & on** [**Github**](https://gist.github.com/alexott/dd43fa8d1db4b8202d55c6325b2c69c2)**. From them I can make following conclusions:**

* **all detectors are equally good on some languages, such as, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese, Greek, Arabic, Farsi, Georgian, etc. - for them the accuracy of detection is between 98 & 100%;**
* **CLD is much better in detection of "rare" languages, especially for languages, that are similar to more frequently used - Afrikaans vs Dutch, Azerbaijani vs. Turkish, Malay vs. Indonesian, Nepali vs. Hindi, Russian vs Bulgarian, etc. \(it could be result of imbalance of training data - I need to check the source dataset\);**
* **for "major" languages not mentioned above \(English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch\) the fastText results are much better than CLD's, and in many cases lingid.py's & OpenNLP's;**
* **for many languages results for "compressed" fastText model are slightly worse than results from "full" model \(mostly only by 1-2%, but could be higher, like for Kazakh when difference is 33%\), but there are languages where the situation is different - results for compressed are slight better than for full \(for example, for German or Dutch\);**

**OpenNLP has many misclassifications for Cyrillic languages - Russian/Ukrainian, ...**

**Rafael Oliveira** [**posted on FB**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1174547215919768/permalink/1702123316495486/?comment_id=1704414996266318&reply_comment_id=1705159672858517&notif_id=1507280476710677&notif_t=group_comment) **a simple diagram that shows what languages are detected better by CLD & what is better handled by fastText**

**Here are some additional notes about differences in behavior of detectors that I observe during analyzing results:**

* **fastText is more reliable than CLD on the short texts;**
* **fastText models & langid.py detect language as Hebrew instead of Jewish as in CLD. Similarly, CLD uses 'in' for Indonesian language instead of standard 'id' used by fastText & langid.py;**
* **fastText distinguish between Cyrillic- & Latin-based versions of Serbian;**
* **CLD tends to incorporate geographical & person's names into detection results - for example, blog post in German about travel to Iceland is detected as Icelandic, while fastText detects it as German;**
* **In extended detection mode CLD tends to select more rare language, like, Galician or Catalan over Spanish, Serbian instead of Russian, etc.**
* **OpenNLP isn't very good in detection for short texts.**

**The models released by fastText development team provides very good alternative to existing language detection tools, like, Google's CLD & langid.py - for most of "popular" languages, these models provides higher detection accuracy comparing to other tools, combined with high speed of detection \(drawback of langid.py\). Even using "compressed" model it's possible to reach good detection accuracy. Although for some less frequently used languages, CLD & langid.py may show better results.**

**Performance-wise, the langid.py is much slower than both CLD & fastText. On average, CLD requires 0.5-1 ms to perform language detection. For fastText & langid.py I don't have precise numbers yet, only approximates based on speed of execution of corresponding programs.**

7. **Really good:** [**BLUE - what is it, how it is calculated?**](https://slator.com/technology/how-bleu-measures-translation-and-why-it-matters/)

**“\[BLEU\] looks at the presence or absence of particular words, as well as the ordering and the degree of distortion—how much they actually are separated in the output.”**

**BLEU’s evaluation system requires two inputs: \(i\) a numerical translation closeness metric, which is then assigned and measured against \(ii\) a corpus of human reference translations.**

**BLEU averages out various metrics using an** [**n-gram method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram)**, a probabilistic language model often used in computational linguistics.**

![BLEU sample](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/lSpgGLtUzukIldm3nDRFBlAigfv_vggMinKuKjeVtIpFSR5r8VnJ6u8sZ9KkrrTuzpzO42tPjfrRlcwQVj9IAbrP6ou6pzd2XzFzxAzqlYSrCmFODdI4WvhMg7CASMk7ybANtrFw)

**The result is typically measured on a 0 to 1 scale, with 1 as the hypothetical “perfect” translation. Since the human reference, against which MT is measured, is always made up of multiple translations, even a human translation would not score a 1, however. Sometimes the score is expressed as multiplied by 100 or, as in the case of Google mentioned above, by 10.**

**a BLEU score offers more of an intuitive rather than an absolute meaning and is best used for relative judgments: “If we get a BLEU score of 35 \(out of 100\), it seems okay, but it actually has no correlation to the quality of the output in any meaningful sense. If it’s less than 15, we can probably safely say it’s very bad. If it’s greater than 60, we probably have some mistake in our testing! So it will generally fall in there.”**

**“Typically, if you have multiple \[human translation\] references, the BLEU score tends to be higher. So if you hear a very large BLEU score—someone gives you a value that seems very high—you can ask them if there are multiple references being used; because, then, that is the reason that the score is actually higher.”**
