**Discrete**

* **Numbers** 
* **Categorical**
* **Categorical data are variables that contain label values rather than numeric values.**

**The number of possible values is often limited to a fixed set.**

* **Categorical variables are often called** [**nominal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_category)**.**
* **labels, usually discrete values such as gender, country of origin, marital status, high-school graduate**

**Continuous \(the opposite of discrete\): real-number values, measured on a continuous scale: height, weight.**

**In order to compute a regression, categorical predictors must be re-expressed as numeric: some form of indicator variables \(0/1\) with a separate indicator for each level of the factor.**

**Discrete with many values are often treated as continuous, i.e. zone numbers - &gt; binary**
