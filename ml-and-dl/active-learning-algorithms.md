## **PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE CLASSIFIER**

1. [**The Passive Aggressive**](https://www.quora.com/Classification-machine-learning-What-is-an-intuitive-explanation-of-the-Passive-Aggressive-classifier) **\(PA\) algorithm is perfect for classifying massive streams of data \(e.g. Twitter\). It's easy to implement and very fast, but does not provide global guarantees like the support-vector machine \(SVM\).**
